BriCOOL is a service app that allows clients to search for a nearby and suitable service  provider and it allows the service provider to search for more clients easily. It is coded in JAVA and connected with a database
</h3>
<br />

## Here is a preview of our App üì∏ :
- The first inteface that appears when we run the app is the *login interface*. Both client and service provider can log in from it.

- If the user hasn't an account yet he will be directed to the *registration interface*, he will be at first asked to select his status (Client or Service provider).
